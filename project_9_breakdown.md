## ðŸ§­ Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Dataset Creation
- 50 reviews: 25 Positive, 25 Negative
- File: `movie_reviews_dataset.csv`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Text Vectorization
- Used `TfidfVectorizer` with stopword removal and lowercase
- Transformed text reviews into numerical vectors

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Model Training
- Classifier: `Logistic Regression`
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- Trained on 80% split
- File: `sentiment_model.joblib`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Packaging
- Saved model and vectorizer using `joblib`
- Files:
  - `models/sentiment_model.joblib`
  - `models/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Streamlit App
- App UI: Enter review â†’ see predicted sentiment
